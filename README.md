If you're reading this, that probably means I specifically decided to show this to you. So, here's a little intro:

**WHAT?**

This is a neural net framework I've made from scratch, specifically set up to solve Flow Free puzzles (fun game).

**WHY?**

Not for actual help solving the puzzles; they're not that hard. Mostly for fun and for the learning experience. My goal was to make everything from scratch (just using std and rand) but as it turns out, it's really hard to do a good job optimizing without help!

**HOW?**

This is my first "major" project in Rust, so it's been quite a lot of learning. I already had this coded in Java but decided to switch for performance reasons. Though it actually ended up being a bit slower... presumably because I don't know enough about Rust yet.

**WHO?**

Me.

**WHEN?**

Now, I guess? Unless you're reading this in the future and I've stopped working on it...

**WHERE?**

This is also my first time using GitHub. I literally just made an account (I thought I already had one but I guess not). So, sorry if it's messed up somehow. I don't know what I'm doing.

**PLANS?**

I'm about to make a new branch that will use the ndarray crate so that I can actually have half-decent performance. My final goal is to see if I can train a network that does a decent job of solving puzzles all the way from 5x5 to 18x18 (the min and max sizes in the game).
