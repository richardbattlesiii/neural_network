If you're reading this, hi! Here's a little intro as to what this project is about:

**WHAT?**

This is a neural net framework I've made from scratch (using ndarray, but that's still "from scratch" in my books). Originally I was using it to solve puzzles from the game Flow Free (where you connect dots on a grid without the lines overlapping).

**WHY?**

Mostly for fun and for the learning experience. My goal was to make everything *entirely* from scratch (just using std and rand) but as it turns out, it's really hard to do a good job optimizing without help! So I started using ndarray.

**HOW?**

This is my first "major" project in Rust, so it's been quite a lot of learning. I already had this coded in Java but decided to switch for performance reasons.

**WHO?**

Me, Richard Battles.

**WHEN?**

Now, I guess? Unless you're reading this in the future and I've stopped working on it?

**WHERE?**

This is also my first time using GitHub. I literally just made an account before writing this (I thought I already had one but I guess not). So, sorry if it's messed up somehow.

**PLANS?**

Got pretty decent results on Flow Free puzzles, so now I want to see if I can use deep Q learning to have an AI play a specific part of the game Everhood for me.
