If you're reading this, hi! Here's a little intro as to what this project is about:

**WHAT?**

This is a neural net framework I've made from scratch.

**WHY?**

Mostly for fun and for the learning experience. My goal was to make everything from scratch (just using std and rand) but as it turns out, it's really hard to do a good job optimizing without help! So I started using ndarray.

**HOW?**

This is my first "major" project in Rust, so it's been quite a lot of learning. I already had this coded in Java but decided to switch for performance reasons.

**WHO?**

Me.

**WHEN?**

Now, I guess? Unless you're reading this in the future and I've stopped working on it...

**WHERE?**

This is also my first time using GitHub. I literally just made an account (I thought I already had one but I guess not). So, sorry if it's messed up somehow. I don't know what I'm doing.

**PLANS?**

Got pretty decent results on Flow Free puzzles, so now I want to see if I can use deep Q learning to have an AI play a specific part of the game Everhood for me.
